            <p>Dear valued Guests,</p>
            <br>
            <p>Stone Villa Pelion team, given the current global events, has taken into
            consideration all the matters regarding our guests’ health and convenience.
            Below we let you know about all the protective procedures which take place
            rigorously at our facilities to keep our guests safe.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Protection</p>
            <p>Stone Villa Pelion hosts one group of guests (families, couples etc.) at a time and
            has its own entrance. Any member of our staff will wear a mask when meeting you,
            maintaining the distance of 2 meters. All members of our team are trained to follow
            excellent hygiene practice and undergo regular temperature checks. Check-in and
            check-out times, unfortunately, won’t have the flexibility of the previous years as
            we need to allow the space to natural aerate in between changes for at least 48
            hours.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Housekeeper service</p>
            <p>Our housekeeper, as usual, will visit to clean, change bed sheets and towels and
            aerate the house, when you are out, while taking all the necessary protection while
            in service.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">After each check-out</p>
            <p>The house is thoroughly cleaned and sanitised using top quality products. AC
            filters are removed and cleaned appropriately. After every check-out the house is
            fully fogged (steam-cleaners with temperatures above 70° are used on mattresses,
            pillows, duvets, cushions, sofas, chairs). The residence will remain vacant for at
            least 48 hours after each check-out, time in which all spaces are naturally ventilated
            whilst the ACs will be operating for several hours every day. Pillow and mattress
            protectors are changed. All bed linen and towels provided are washed and ironed in
            boiling temperatures, as informed by our colleague service.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our part as a team is to make sure we protect all of our guests and staff through any
            means necessary and provide you with a convenient and excellent experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thank you for your time, and we look forward to welcoming you soon at Stone Villa
            Pelion.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Team of Stone Villa Pelion.</p>
